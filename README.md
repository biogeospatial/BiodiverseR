# Biodiverse-R
R interface for Biodiverse

## Work plan
The following tasks are required:
- creating a template for R package
- adding relevant binaries to R package
- setting up a link between R package and Biodiverse tool in perl
- expanding the link to all required functionalities of the Biodiverse tool
- testing and workflows

## Notes
- all operating systems should be considered
- system based invocation of initial binaries is expected (INSTSRV.EXE ? SRVANY.EXE?)
- Biodiverse perl tool should act as a service
