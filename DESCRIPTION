Description: BiodiverseR provides an interface to the Biodiverse. 
    Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices 
    based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, trait and matrix-based 
    (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, as well as related environmental 
    and temporal variations. More information for the Biodiverse tool is 
    available on its Github page: https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse.
