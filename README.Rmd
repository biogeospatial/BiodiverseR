Provides an R interface to the spatial analyses available in Biodiverse. Biodiverse 
is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, 
phylogenetic, trait and matrix-based (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, 
as well as related environmental and temporal variations. More information is 
available at its [Github page](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse).

## Installation

This is a two step process.  First, install the Biodiverse engine.  Second, install the R package.  

1. Install the Biodiverse engine. 

This currently requires a working perl interpreter in your path.
(Future versions will provide self contained executables).

On Windows a perl interpreter can be obtained through the [Strawberry perl project](https://strawberryperl.com/releases.html).
Most unix-derived systems provide a perl interpreter but it is best to avoid this and use
a system like [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/).  Be sure to also install the cpanm utility (see
perlbrew site for details).  

Once you have a perl installed and in your path you can install the perl dependencies using
cpanm at the command line.  (Make sure to update the below code to use the correct path separator
on Windows).  Note that this requires that you have git installed on your system and in the path.

This code also assumes you have run a git clone of this repo and are at the top level of this repo.


``` bash
cpanm https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse.git
cd inst/perl
cpanm --installdeps .
```

Note that the above will take a while if you do not already have the GDAL development
package installed on your system.  This is because it will compile its own version if
it is unable to find one on the system (but maybe this is not such a bad thing as then
it will be isolated from system changes).

If you want to see things as they happen then add the verbose flag to the cpanm calls (```cpanm --verbose ...```).

2. Install the R code


You can install the R code like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("shawnlaffan/BiodiverseR")
```

However, it is currently best to work within the git repo.  

```r
devtools::load_all()
```
  
## Quick demo

Check that the Biodiverse service can be accessed.  The analytical functions
call this internally so this is just a check that the server can be started.

```{r}
# It is critical that this be set to wherever you have downloaded the package 
#  as otherwise the system will not find the server code.  
#  It is an ugly and temporary hack and will not be needed in the future.
#  This version assumes you are at the top level of the BiodiverseR repository.  
Sys.setenv("Biodiverse_basepath" = getwd())

#  library(BiodiverseR)
devtools::load_all()  #  for during development 
cs = start_server()
cs$server_object$is_alive()

#  cleanup
rm(cs)
gc()  #  server is not deleted until garbage collected
```
